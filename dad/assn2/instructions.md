1. We specify the address and port of a public time server, which we'll use to get the current time.

2. The get_current_time_from_server function sends an empty UDP message to the time server and receives a response containing the current time in Unix timestamp format. It then converts this timestamp to a human-readable time format using time.ctime.

3. In the main function, we call get_current_time_from_server to retrieve and display the current time from the time server.
